# 🚀 Hacker News Extension Setup Guide

## ✅ **Step 3 Complete: Authentication System Implemented!**

I've successfully implemented the complete authentication system for your Hacker News Chrome extension. Here's what's been added:

### 🔐 **Authentication Features:**

**1. User Interface:**
- ✅ Login/Register buttons in the top-left corner
- ✅ User profile section (shows when logged in)
- ✅ Authentication modals with forms
- ✅ Profile modal with user stats and actions

**2. Story Actions:**
- ✅ Save button on each story
- ✅ Read Later button on each story
- ✅ Visual feedback when articles are saved
- ✅ Hover effects and state management

**3. Backend API:**
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ Save/Read Later article endpoints
- ✅ User profile management

### 🛠️ **Setup Instructions:**

**1. Start the Backend Server:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`

**2. Load the Chrome Extension:**
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `hacker-news-extension` folder
5. The extension should now be loaded and working!

**3. Test the Features:**
- Open a new tab to see the Hacker News interface
- Click "Sign Up" to create an account
- Click "Sign In" to log in
- Try saving articles with the "Save" and "Read Later" buttons
- Click on your profile to see saved articles count

### 🎯 **What's Working:**

**Authentication:**
- User registration with email/password
- User login with JWT tokens
- Automatic token verification
- User profile display
- Logout functionality

**Article Management:**
- Save articles to "Saved" list
- Add articles to "Read Later" list
- Visual feedback for saved articles
- User-specific article storage

**UI/UX:**
- Modern dark theme with glassmorphism
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design
- Error handling and notifications

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

**If you see "Failed to fetch" errors:**
1. Make sure the backend server is running on port 3000
2. Check that MongoDB is running
3. Verify the extension has the correct permissions

**If authentication doesn't work:**
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the backend API endpoints are responding
3. Make sure the JWT secret is set in the backend

### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

The extension is now fully functional with:
- ✅ Hacker News story display
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Save/Read Later functionality
- ✅ Modern UI/UX
- ✅ Backend API integration

You can now use the extension to browse Hacker News stories and save your favorites!

### 📝 **API Endpoints:**

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

**Articles:**
- `POST /api/articles/save` - Save an article
- `GET /api/articles/saved` - Get saved articles
- `GET /api/articles/read-later` - Get read-later articles

The extension is now ready to use! 🎉
